/**
 * Write a function named quizAverage
 * It takes an array of quiz objects that look like this:
 *  *   {
      quizNumber: 3,
      quizScore: 13,
      maxScore: 20
      }
 * And calculates the average score.  The function should return a number (scaled out of 100) for the quiz average.
 * Note:
 * 1. The average score is given by the sum of all scores divided by the count of the quizzes.
 * 2. You will have to convert quiz scores to percentages before they are useful to your calculations.  This is simply
 *   (quizScore/maxScore) * 100
 * 3. You should return a number scaled to be out of 100, and rounded down to an integer.  You can use Math.round(someNumber) to do the rounding for you.
 * Example:
  let quizzes = [
    { quizNumber: 1, quizScore: 8, maxScore: 10 },
    { quizNumber: 2, quizScore: 4, maxScore: 5 },
    { quizNumber: 3, quizScore: 5, maxScore: 7 },
    { quizNumber: 4, quizScore: 11, maxScore: 10 },
    { quizNumber: 5, quizScore: 3, maxScore: 5 }
  ]

  averageQuizScore(quizzes) // 80

function averageQuizScore() {
  //Write Code Here
}

// do not touch this export
module.exports = averageQuizScore;
