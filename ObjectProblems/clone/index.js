 * Write a function named clone:
 * 1. It should return a totally new object.
 * 2. Define a parameter named targetObj
 * 3. All the keys from targetObj should be present in the returned object.
 * 4. All the values from targetObj should be represented in the returned object.
 * Remember:
 * You'll probably have to loop over the keys and copy the data into a new object.
