/**
 * Write a function named guidedTour:
 *
 * 1. This function takes two arguments:
 *    - A string that represents the starting point.
 *    - An object with keys and values that are stops along a guided tour of a city.
 * 2. This function returns an array of strings that represents each stop of the guided tour.
 * 3. The first index of this array will be the starting point.
 * 4. The array that is returned should include the final destination, even though it won't be a key in the tourist map.
 *
 * For example:
 * let newYorkMap = {
      "Times Square": "Brooklyn Bridge",
      "Central Park": "Statue of Liberty",
      "Statue of Liberty": "Times Square",
      "Brooklyn Bridge": "Grand Central Terminal"
      }

  guidedTour("Times Square", newYorkMap)
  // [ Times Square, Brooklyn Bridge, Grand Central Terminal ]

function guidedTour() {
